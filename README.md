- 👋 Hi, I’m @mawilhite2
- 👀 I’m interested in ansible, docker, and homelab
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python (brand new to coding/development), how to use ansible to automate deployment and updates for my home based services running in docker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn.
